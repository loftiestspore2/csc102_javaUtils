# csc102_javaUtils
this is a repository that i am continuously working on due to my constant solutions using similar lines of code 
(honestly speaking this is to aid my lazyness no more copy and paste(cntrlC->cntrlV) only imports)
for now this utils will have many methods that are helpful for unit tests and non labour intensive debugging 
this utils might enclude a bit of c or c++ but we'll see (highly unlightly (very un neat ))
